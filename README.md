# ProxiMap

Proximap is a responsive web app for finding nearby public infrastructure, and uses drinking fountains as a showcase example.
It is being developed in conjunction with [Datablue](https://github.com/water-fountains/datablue), a tool for collecting, aggregating, and serving
fountain data from Open Street Map, Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikipedia. Check out [water-fountains.org](https://water-fountains.org)
for more information on the overall project, and [beta.water-fountains.org](https://beta.water-fountains.org) to see a beta version of the app!

The project is open source under the GNU Affero General Public License, with a profit contribution agreement applying under restricted conditions. See [COPYING](/COPYING) for information.
